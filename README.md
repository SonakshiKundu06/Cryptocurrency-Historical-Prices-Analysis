# 📊 Cryptocurrency Price Analysis Dashboard

## 📝 Overview
This project analyzes the historical price movements of **Bitcoin (BTC)**, **AAVE**, and **Litecoin (LTC)** using statistical methods and a machine-learning–based Linear Regression model. The Power BI dashboard provides visual insights into trends, volatility, correlations, and price predictions to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## 📁 Dataset Description
The project uses three separate datasets:

- **Bitcoin Dataset**
- **AAVE Dataset**
- **Litecoin Dataset**

Each dataset typically includes:
- Date  
- Open, High, Low, Close prices  
- Volume  
- Market indicators  

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Removed missing and inconsistent values  
- Converted date fields to proper datetime format  
- Normalized numerical features for ML modeling  

### 📈 Statistical Analysis
- Summary statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation)  
- Price volatility comparison across the three coins  
- Price Prediction of all three coins (OHLC data)

### 📊 Trend & Pattern Exploration
- Long-term and short-term price movement patterns  
- Daily/weekly price fluctuations  
- High–Low spread analysis for volatility insights  

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
### **Linear Regression Price Prediction**
A Linear Regression model was trained to predict **Close Price** based on OHLC data.  
📌 *The model shows a clear linear trend between historical patterns and future price predictions.*

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- Bitcoin remains the most stable yet consistently trending asset.  
- AAVE shows higher volatility with sharp up/down cycles.  
- Litecoin demonstrates moderate fluctuations with steady trends.  
- Correlation analysis indicates strong relationships between OHLC values within each coin.
